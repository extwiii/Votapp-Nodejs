Prerequisites
-------------
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/downloads)
- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)
- [mLab](https://mlab.com/) Database-as-a-Service
- [Finding your database connection info](http://docs.mlab.com/connecting/#connect-string)
- Set value of process.env in ([How to set](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13333221/how-to-change-value-of-process-env-port-in-node-js))
  - config/database.js process.env.MONGO_VOTING
  - config/auth.js
    - process.env.TWITTER_KEY
    - process.env.TWITTER_SECRET
    - process.env.TWITTER_URL
    - process.env.GITHUB_ID
    - process.env.GITHUB_SECRET
    - process.env.GITHUB_URL
- If you are deploying on Heroku, don't forget to set your config vars ([How to set](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars))
    
Now you are done, Ready to go!

Getting Started
-------------

The easiest way to get started is to clone the repository:

```bash
# Get the latest snapshot
git clone https://github.com/extwiii/Votapp-Node.js.git

# Change directory
cd Votapp-Nodejs

# Install NPM dependencies
npm install

# Then simply start your app
node server.js

# Or, You can use gulp, it will also run mocha for test
gulp
```

**Note:** I highly recommend installing [Nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon).
It watches for any changes in your  node.js app and automatically restarts the
server. Once installed, instead of `node server.js` use `nodemon`. It will
save you a lot of time in the long run, because you won't need to manually
restart the server each time you make a small change in code. To install, run
`sudo npm install -g nodemon`.  


Obtaining API Keys
------------------

To use any of the included APIs(twitter, github and many more) methods, you will need
to obtain appropriate credentials: Client ID, Client Secret, API Key, or
Username & Password. You will need to go through each provider to generate new
credentials.

<img src="https://g.twimg.com/ios_homescreen_icon.png" width="90">
- Sign in at <a href="https://apps.twitter.com/" target="_blank">https://apps.twitter.com</a>
- Click **Create a new application**
- Enter your application name, website and description
- For **Callback URL**: http://127.0.0.1:8080/auth/twitter/callback
- Go to **Settings** tab
- Under *Application Type* select **Read and Write** access
- Check the box **Allow this application to be used to Sign in with Twitter**
- Click **Update this Twitter's applications settings**
- Copy and paste *Consumer Key* and *Consumer Secret* keys into `config/auth.js` file
- After test your key, you can also set your key as a process.env ([How to set](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13333221/how-to-change-value-of-process-env-port-in-node-js))

Deployment
----------

Once you are ready to deploy your app, you will need to create an account with
a cloud platform to host it. These are not the only choices, but they are my top
picks. From my experience, **Heroku** is the easiest to get started with, it will
automatically restart your Node.js process when it crashes, zero-downtime
deployments and custom domain support on free accounts. Additionally, you can
create an account with **mLab** and then pick one of the *4* providers below.
Again, there are plenty of other choices and you are not limited to just the ones
listed below.

### 1-Step Deployment with Heroku

<img src="http://blog.exadel.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/heroku-Logo-1.jpg" width="200">
- Download and install [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/)
- In terminal, run `heroku login` and enter your Heroku credentials
- From *your app* directory run `heroku create`
- Run `heroku addons:create mongolab`.  This will set up the mLab add-on and configure the `MONGOLAB_URI` environment variable in your Heroku app for you.
- Lastly, do `git push heroku master`.  Done!

**Note:** To install Heroku add-ons your account must be verified.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/7KnCa5a.png" width="200">
- Open [mlab.com](https://mlab.com) website
- Click the yellow **Sign up** button
- Fill in your user information then hit **Create account**
- From the dashboard, click on **:zap:Create new** button
- Select **any** cloud provider (I usually go with AWS)
- Under *Plan* click on **Single-node (development)** tab and select **Sandbox** (it's free)
 - *Leave MongoDB version as is - `2.4.x`*
- Enter *Database name** for your web app
- Then click on **:zap:Create new MongoDB deployment** button
- Now, to access your database you need to create a DB user
- Click to the recently created database
- You should see the following message:
 - *A database user is required to connect to this database.* **Click here** *to create a new one.*
- Click the link and fill in **DB Username** and **DB Password** fields
- Finally, in `.env` instead of `mongodb://localhost:27017/test`, use the following URI with your credentials:
 - `db: 'mongodb://USERNAME:PASSWORD@ds027479.mongolab.com:27479/DATABASE_NAME'`

**Note:** As an alternative to mLab, there is also [Compose](https://www.compose.io/).


<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/Windows_Azure_logo.png" width="200">

- Login to [Windows Azure Management Portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com/)
- Click the **+ NEW** button on the bottom left of the portal
- Click **COMPUTE**, then **WEB APP**, then **QUICK CREATE**
- Enter a name for **URL** and select the datacenter **REGION** for your web site
- Click on **CREATE WEB APP** button
- Once the web site status changes to *Running*, click on the name of the web site to access the Dashboard
- At the bottom right of the Quickstart page, select **Set up a deployment from source control**
- Select **Local Git repository** from the list, and then click the arrow
- To enable Git publishing, Azure will ask you to create a user name and password
- Once the Git repository is ready, you will be presented with a **GIT URL**
- Inside your *Hackathon Starter* directory, run `git remote add azure [Azure Git URL]`
- To push your changes simply run `git push azure master`
 - **Note:** *You will be prompted for the password you created earlier*
- On **Deployments** tab of your Windows Azure Web App, you will see the deployment history

<img src="http://www.comparethecloud.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/ibm-bluemix_pr-030514.jpg" width="200">

- Go to [Codename: Bluemix](http://bluemix.net) to signup for the free trial, or login with your *IBM id*
- Install [Cloud Foundry CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli)
- Navigate to your **hackathon-starter** directory and then run `cf push [your-app-name] -m 512m` command to deploy the application
 - **Note:** You must specify a unique application name in place of `[your-app-name]`
- Run `cf create-service mongodb 100 [your-service-name]` to create a [MongoDB service](https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#services/MongoDB/index.html#MongoDB)
- Run `cf bind-service [your-app-name] [your-service-name]` to associate your application with a service created above
- Run `cf files [your-app-name] logs/env.log` to see the *environment variables created for MongoDB.
- Copy the **MongoDB URI** that should look something like the following: `mongodb://68638358-a3c6-42a1-bae9-645b607d55e8:46fb97e6-5ce7-4146-9a5d-d623c64ff1fe@192.155.243.23:10123/db`
- Then set it as an environment variable for your application by running `cf set-env [your-app-name] MONGODB_URI [your-mongodb-uri]`
- Run `cf restart [your-app-name]` for the changes to take effect.
- Visit your starter app at **http://[your-app-name].ng.bluemix.net**
- Done!
